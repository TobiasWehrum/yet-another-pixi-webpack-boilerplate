Yet Another Pixi & Webpack Boilerplate
======================================

Because I like to get a head start on my own Pixi projects I made this boilerplate - and
because I like sharing things, I'm publishing it here. For now, please excuse the lack
of documentation. That'll change soon!

I'll also add a proper feature list. Ad the moment, the boilerplate mainly consists of:
- Pixi 4.8
- Webpack 4
- Babel 7

In the near future, I'll probably add more of my favourite tools, e.g. ESLint, Preact and
styled-components.

Oh, and a word of warning: I'm not an expert at JS tooling. I'm using this boilerplate
and I'll fix any problems I can find, but if you see anything that can be improved, just
open an issue or send me a message at [Tobias.Wehrum@dragonlab.de](mailto:Tobias.Wehrum@dragonlab.de).

The initial webpack configuration was based on [this gist](https://gist.github.com/Nek-/b9775f7a88eb896db8afc37a89db3771)
by [Nek-](https://gist.github.com/Nek-). Thanks a lot for posting that!
